This project is to build a rover that will detect human and follow it.

For the current progress, the rover can detect human and send ros_msg to the Arduino through rosserial

## [human_detection](/MSD700_Follow_Me/human_detection/)
This folder contain all the code to detect human before putting it to the ros package

## [msd700_ws](/MSD700_Follow_Me/msd700_ws/)
This folder contain all the code for running ROS workspace in other device. The code has been tested in itbdelabof3 computer.
