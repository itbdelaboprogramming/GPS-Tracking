Goals for the GPS tracking development
- change the prototype physical configuration from using ArduPilot Pixhawk to Arduino Mega with ESP8266
- migrate the system from plug and play to configure each components manually
- increase the accuracy by using the encoder and the IMU sensor then implementing x-Kalman Filter
- test run
- make the development report and submit to NIW
