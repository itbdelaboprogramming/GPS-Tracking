Goals for the GPS tracking development
- change the prototype physical configuration from using ArduPilot Pixhawk to Arduino Mega with ESP8266
- migrate the system from plug and play to configure each components manually
- increase the accuracy by using the encoder and the IMU sensor then implementing x-Kalman Filter
- test run
- make the development report and submit to NIW

For user interface, we'll use Mission Planner for the time being

Some necessary documents:
- Instruction manual for beginner and hands-on manual
  ^ make the work flowchart
  ^ make the word or ppt instruction
  ^ explanation session or a short training tutorial
